STEPS - 
1.) First sort the elements and get the maximum distance
2.) Now check whether distance value in the range from 1 to maximum distance follows the following conditions - 
 i.) Maintain a variable to count the number of cows
 ii.) whether the pair have the value greater than the distance value in the range 
 iii.) Increment the value of the variable if condition ii satisfies and check whether the it is equal to the values given to us.
3.) If all conditions are true then you can say that the disstance can be taken into consideration
